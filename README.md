### Hi I'm Nico :v:

Full-Stack Junior Developer currently studying at the prestigious
programming school 4️⃣2️⃣ :m:álaga.
This school teaches us how the profile of a programmer should be throughout his professional life.
Teamwork, frustration tolerance, continuous learning, and most importantly, to grow professionally while having fun
programming alone and in teams.
I am excited about the idea of contributing my energy and enthusiasm to your company and the team and being able to
continue my personal development and contribute my knowledge.
Enjoy my GitHub profile!
