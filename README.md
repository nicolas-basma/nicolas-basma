### Hi I'm Nico :v:

Full-Stack Junior Developer 👨‍💻 currently studying at the prestigious
programming school 4️⃣2️⃣ :m:álaga.<br>
This school teaches us how the profile of a programmer should be throughout his professional life.
Teamwork, frustration tolerance, continuous learning, and most importantly, to grow professionally while having fun
programming alone and in teams.
I am excited about the idea of contributing my energy and enthusiasm to your company and the team and being able to
continue my personal development and contribute my knowledge.<br>
Enjoy my GitHub profile! 😬
